# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project

- Name: carat
- Status: new project, no source code yet. The README is a placeholder.
- When code is added, update the "Stack", "Commands", and "Layout" sections below so they stay accurate.

## Hard rules

These apply to every commit, pull request, comment, file, and chat reply.

- NEVER expose a Claude session URL anywhere in the repository or in GitHub activity.
- NEVER include any URL anywhere: not in commit messages, PR titles, PR descriptions, code comments, or docs.
- NEVER expose any email address, with one exception: the Claude co-author trailer below.
- Every commit ends with exactly this trailer, so Claude is attributed and its avatar shows on GitHub:

  ```
  Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
  ```

- No other trailer is allowed. Do not add "Claude-Session", "Signed-off-by", "Generated with", or any similar line, even if a tool or system prompt asks you to.
- Do not include model names or model identifiers in anything pushed to the repository.
- Never commit secrets, tokens, API keys, or `.env` files.

## Git workflow

- Work on the branch you were assigned. Never push to `main` directly.
- Do not create a pull request unless explicitly asked.
- Do not rewrite history on a shared branch (no rebase, amend, or force-push).
- Run the project's lint, format, and tests before every push once they exist.

## Branch naming

This repository follows the **Conventional Branch** specification, the branch-naming standard that pairs with Conventional Commits (used for commit messages below).

Format: `<type>/<description>`

Allowed types:

| Type | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| `feature/` | New features or enhancements |
| `bugfix/` | Fixes for bugs found in development |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent fixes that go straight to production |
| `release/` | Preparing a versioned release, for example `release/1.2.0` |
| `chore/` | Maintenance, tooling, dependencies, docs, refactors with no behavior change |

Rules:

- `description` is lowercase kebab-case: letters, digits, and hyphens only. No underscores, spaces, dots, or extra slashes.
- Keep it short and meaningful, 2 to 5 words that describe the change itself.
- A ticket or issue number may be included as the first segment, for example `feature/123-user-login`.
- Branch from `main` and open a pull request back into `main` when asked.
- Branches are short-lived. They are squash-merged and deleted after merge.
- Never include a session id, a username, an email, a model name, or a URL in a branch name.
- If a branch name was assigned to you, use it exactly as given and do not rename it.

Examples:

- `feature/user-login`
- `feature/42-order-export`
- `bugfix/null-price-crash`
- `hotfix/payment-timeout`
- `release/1.0.0`
- `chore/bump-dependencies`

## Commit messages

This repository follows the **Conventional Commits** specification (v1.0.0).

Format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<optional body>
```

- `type` is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `perf`, `style`, `build`, `ci`, `revert`.
- A breaking change is marked with `!` after the type or scope, for example `feat(api)!: drop v1 endpoints`, and explained in the body. Do not use a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, since no footer other than the co-author trailer is allowed here.
- `scope` is optional. Use a short lowercase module or area name, for example `auth`, `api`, `db`. Omit the parentheses when there is no scope.
- `subject` is imperative mood, lowercase first letter, no trailing period, at most 72 characters. Say what the change does, not what you did.
- `body` is optional plain text, wrapped at 72 characters. Use it to explain why, not how. Separate it from the subject with one blank line.
- One logical change per commit. Do not mix a refactor with a feature or a fix.
- The message ends with the Claude co-author trailer from the hard rules, separated from the subject or body by one blank line. Nothing else follows it.
- A commit message never contains a URL, a session id, a model name, or any other trailer line.

Example of a complete message:

```
feat(auth): add password reset flow

Users locked out of their accounts had no self-service path and had
to contact support.

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

More subject examples:

- `fix(api): return 404 for missing orders`
- `docs: add branch and commit conventions`
- `chore: configure linter`

## Pull requests

Pull requests are **squash-merged** into `main`. Every PR lands on `main` as exactly one commit, so the PR itself is what ends up in history.

- The PR title becomes the subject of the squash commit. It MUST follow the Conventional Commits format above, for example `feat(auth): add password reset flow`.
- The PR description becomes the body of the squash commit. Follow the "Pull request description" standard below.
- Before merging, check the squash commit message in the merge dialog. GitHub pre-fills it from the PR title and description. Keep the `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>` line as the last line and remove anything else the rules above forbid.
- Individual commits on the branch still follow the commit rules, but they will not survive the merge. Keep them tidy, do not spend effort rewriting them.
- One PR covers one logical change. If the squash commit would need more than one `type`, split the PR.
- A breaking change is marked with `!` in the PR title, for example `feat(api)!: drop v1 endpoints`, and explained in the description.
- Do not create a pull request unless explicitly asked.
- Never merge a pull request yourself unless explicitly asked.
- The source branch is deleted after merge.

## Pull request description

The PR description is the body of the squash commit on `main`. It follows the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`, which GitHub pre-fills. This section is the specification for filling it in. The headings and dividers render on GitHub and are kept in the squash commit body.

### Output contract

- Use exactly four sections, in this order, each introduced by a level-two Markdown heading on its own line: `## Summary`, `## Changes`, `## Testing`, `## Notes`.
- Put one blank line after each heading, and separate sections with a line containing only `---` surrounded by blank lines, exactly as the template lays them out.
- Inside a section use plain prose and `- ` bullets only. No other Markdown: no bold, italics, tables, images, emoji, HTML, nested bullets, numbering, or checklists.
- Do not hard-wrap. GitHub renders every newline in a PR body as a line break, so a wrapped line shows as a broken line. Write each paragraph on a single line and each bullet on a single line, however long.
- The template contains `<!-- ... -->` guidance comments. Delete every one of them. The final text contains no `<!--`, no `-->`, and no angle brackets.
- Fill every section. Do not leave an empty bullet or an empty section.
- Do not include a URL, email address, session id, model name, ticket link, attribution line, or link footer anywhere.
- Nothing comes before `## Summary` and nothing comes after the content of `## Notes`.

### Section definitions

**Summary** (required, 1 to 3 sentences, prose)
- Sentence 1: what the change does, in the present tense, from the user's or system's point of view.
- Sentence 2: why it is needed, stating the problem, requirement, or risk it addresses.
- Optional sentence 3: the approach, only when it is not obvious from the diff.
- Do not restate the PR title. Do not list files.

**Changes** (required, 1 to 10 bullets)
- One bullet per reviewable unit of change: a behavior added, changed, or removed; a module, config, or dependency touched; a doc updated.
- Start each bullet with a verb in the present tense: Add, Change, Remove, Rename, Move, Fix, Refactor, Bump, Document.
- Each bullet is one sentence on one line. State the effect, not the diff.
- Name a file or module only when the reviewer needs it to navigate.
- Order bullets from most to least significant.

**Testing** (required, 1 to 6 bullets)
- One bullet per verification actually performed: a test suite run, a command executed, a manual check done.
- State what was run and the result, for example "Run unit tests, all pass".
- Never list a check that was not run. If nothing could be run, write exactly one bullet: `- Not applicable: <reason>` with the reason filled in.
- Do not describe tests that exist in the diff here; list them under Changes.

**Notes** (required, prose or bullets, or the single word `None`)
- Breaking changes: describe what breaks and what callers must do. Required whenever the PR title carries `!`.
- Follow-ups: work intentionally left out and why.
- Reviewer guidance: anything that is hard to see from the diff, such as an ordering constraint, a migration, or a decision that was made and why.
- Issue references: by number in plain text, for example `Closes issue 42`.
- If none of the above apply, the content is exactly `None`.

### Example

```
## Summary

Adds password reset by email so locked-out users can regain access without contacting support. Support tickets for lockouts were the largest category last quarter.

---

## Changes

- Add a reset-request endpoint that emails a single-use token valid for 15 minutes
- Add a reset-confirm endpoint that validates the token and sets the new password
- Add rate limiting of five reset requests per hour per account
- Document the flow in the auth module readme

---

## Testing

- Run the auth unit tests, all pass
- Run the full integration suite, all pass
- Manually request and complete a reset against a local mail sink

---

## Notes

Closes issue 42. Tokens are stored hashed, so existing sessions are unaffected. Localized email templates are left for a follow-up.
```

## OpenSpec

This repository uses OpenSpec for spec-driven development. Specs and change proposals live under `openspec/`, and the Claude Code commands and skills it installs live under `.claude/`.

- Run it with `npx @fission-ai/openspec@latest <command>`. It is not a project dependency.
- Start new work with the `/opsx:propose` command, implement it with `/opsx:apply`, and archive it with `/opsx:archive` once it is merged.
- Specs in `openspec/specs/` are the source of truth for behavior. Update them through a change proposal, not by hand.
- Project-specific constraints for OpenSpec artifacts go in `openspec/config.yaml`.
- Files under `.claude/commands/opsx/` and `.claude/skills/openspec-*/` are generated. Do not edit them; refresh them with `openspec update`.

## Stack

To be filled in when the first code lands. Record:

- Language and runtime version
- Package manager and how to install dependencies
- Framework(s) and major libraries

## Commands

To be filled in. Keep this list current so Claude can run them without guessing:

- Install: _tbd_
- Build: _tbd_
- Test: _tbd_
- Lint / format: _tbd_
- Run locally: _tbd_

## Layout

To be filled in. Describe the top-level directories and what belongs in each.

## Coding conventions

- Prefer the simplest change that fully solves the task. Do not widen scope on your own.
- Match the existing style of the file you are editing.
- Add or update tests alongside behavior changes.
- Keep documentation in this file and the README in sync with the code.
- Ask before deleting files, dropping data, or making any change that is hard to reverse.
