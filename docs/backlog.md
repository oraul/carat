# Backlog

Known items to fix in later changes. A finding that a change does not fix, because it is outside the change's scope or below the confidence the contributor agent acts on, is recorded here with where it is in the code, why it matters, and how to fix it, so that it is not lost and the next change can start from it. Each item is removed by the change that fixes it, through the OpenSpec loop like any other change.

## make types leaves build/carat.rbs that a later spin build warns about

- Where: the `types` target in the `Makefile` writes `build/carat.rbs` with `--emit-rbs`, inside the tree `spin` scans.
- Why it matters: `spinel_rbs_extract` reports a parse failure on the emitted file at every later `spin build`, `spin test`, and `make snapshots`, because of a doubled namespace separator in the class names it writes; the noise hides real warnings and the file has to be deleted by hand. Observed during the Struct change and again during the command grammar change.
- Fix outline: have the `types` target write the file outside the `spin` source tree, or delete it after printing.

## The file tree's cursor drifts when follow expands directories above it

- Where: `Carat::Plugins::Explorer::Plugin#follow` in `carat/plugins/explorer/plugin.rb`, and the plugin API, whose `move_cursor` request moves only the current window's cursor.
- Why it matters: while the tree is open but not current, opening a file in another directory expands that directory and inserts lines above the tree's cursor, which then sits on a different entry than before; Neovim's tree plugins move the tree's cursor to the followed file. `:ExplorerFind` and opening the tree put the cursor right, so only the unfocused case drifts.
- Fix outline: add a request that moves the cursor of a window by number (or of the plugin's scratch window by title) without focusing it, bump the API minor version, and have `follow` put the tree's cursor on the marked row after it refreshes.

## The plugin API cannot read or set the visual selection

- Where: `Carat::PluginApi::Host` and `BufferView` in `carat/plugin_api.rb`, and the requests in `carat/use_cases/plugins/plugin_host.rb`; `docs/architecture.md` section 9.1 lists reading the selection and setting one among the requests a plugin can make.
- Why it matters: the visual modes keep each window's selection (its anchor, the cursor, and the kind from the mode, plus the last selection for `gv`), but a plugin cannot see it, so a plugin action bound in a visual map (a formatter, a comment toggle, a finder seeded with the selected text) has no way to know what was selected. The `visual-modes` change left the API at 1.1, because the plugin API was outside its scope.
- Fix outline: add the selection to `BufferView` (kind, anchor row and column, cursor row and column, `""` kind outside visual mode) and a `set_selection(kind, from_row, from_col, to_row, to_col)` request validated like `move_cursor`, bump `PluginApi::VERSION` to 1.2, and document both in `docs/plugins.md`.
